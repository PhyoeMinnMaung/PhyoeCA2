			<p>Our service is founded on 2014 by two friends, Aung and Phyoe. Once we became students in Ireland as international students, we have many experience an international students. We decided to establish this service for the international students to start their student carrer easily as in our time, we have many difficulties to overcome each steps. From 2017, we enlarged our service more than counselling service. We contracted accommodation companies and start provide accommodation for our students. Beside, we also start provide airport transport service for our students. We are now more than 500 students who have already join with us. We participate student welcome events twice a year for our students to know each other and to make network link for them. We are aiming to service what everything the students need.</p>
